memory allocation


In java script , the memory allocation is basically of two types 


Stored in Stack 
and stored in Heap 

Stack
 ______________     
|             |          // Consider i added   int ans = 5
|             |              it will store in the stack and 
|             |              its copy , if we use it again 
| ans         |             newans = ans;
| newans      |             Now if we change in newans
|_ans_________|          it does'nt mean it will change ans also
                          newans is holdng a copy of ans
Heap
______________
|             |
|             |          in heap basically we got directly
|  {id:5      |          referecnce 
|,Name="dhruv |          for example 
|          }  |      obj={ id :5 , name="dhruv"}
|             |       object 2= obj
|_____________|      now bsically what happend if you make change in  object 2 then it will change in obj also.
