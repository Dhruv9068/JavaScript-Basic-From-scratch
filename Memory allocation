memory allocation


In java script , the memory allocation is basically of two types 


Stored in Stack 
and stored in Heap 

Stack
 ______________     
|             |          // Consider i added   int ans = 5
|             |              it will store in the stack and 
|             |              its copy , if we use it again 
| ans         |             newans = ans;
| newans      |             Now if we change in newans
|_ans_________|          it does'nt mean it will change ans also
                          newans is holdng a copy of ans
Heap
